# scapy-scripts
A collection of (crappy) scapy scripts, mostly scripts that I wrote for aiding in pen tests and security audits.


ipidseq.py        - A script to check IP ID generation pattern. Takes an IP adress as command-line argument.
ipidscanner.py    - A script to scan a victim through zombie. Takes a zombie IP, victim IP, victim port as arguments.
mail_sniffer.py   - A script that sniffs SMTP traffic and prints the payload(used to sniff usernames & passwords on LAN).
